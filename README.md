➣ Data Source: Zillow allows free listings of homes for sale by owners or agents. Zillow’s online and mobile search tools, including its smartphone app, let users search for a property and view estimated property values for free. We obtained our dataset from a contributor on Kaggle who compiled sales data on the United States states as a whole instead of isolated urban housing markets. Data description and source can be find here.

Note: Latest update: January 5th, 2020. Retail housing data across 50 states in the US and Washington D.C.
